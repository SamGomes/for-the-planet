# For the Planet

“For the Planet” is a Collective Risk Dilemma (CRD) game focusing on climate change. 
Following the CRD convention, in our game, players try to avoid an environmental collapse, balancing their own Economic Development or individual profit – the private good which is affected only by a player’s actions; with the shared Environment State – the public good which is affected by the actions of every player, both variables clamped to [0, 1]. When the Environment state reaches 0.001, the game ends with an environmental collapse, and a collective loss (no one gets any profit). If the players survive for 20 rounds, the player with the highest economic development wins. Each round of the game is composed of four different phases: 

- The first phase of each round is the Budget Allocation Phase. In this phase, the players have 5 investment points that they need to allocate to either the Economic Development and/or Environment State. Information about other players’ budget allocations is hidden while the player completes this phase; 
- After allocating their budget, players enter the Display History Phase where the value of all players allocations in the last round are displayed (thus, each player can perceive the cooperation level of each other player); 
- Next, players enter the Investment Execution Phase. This phase stochastically calculates the results of the players’ investments by summing the values obtained from rolling as many six-sided die as points allocated for each investment type; 
- The last phase is the Decay Simulation Phase, which simulates a “natural” decay of the public and private goods. The Environment State decay is stochastically calculated by rolling nine six-sided dice. The decay value is then subtracted from the current Environment State. The Economic Development decay for each player is calculated in a similar fashion, but rolling only three dice.
